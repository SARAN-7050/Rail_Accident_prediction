Overview
The Rail Accident Prediction project is a machine learning-based system that predicts the likelihood of rail accidents based on historical data and real-time inputs. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and information about the dataset used for training.

Features
Data Collection: The project collects historical rail accident data from various sources.
Data Preprocessing: It preprocesses and cleans the data to make it suitable for machine learning.
Machine Learning Models: The project employs various machine learning algorithms for accident prediction.
Real-time Prediction: Users can input real-time data to get instant accident likelihood predictions.
Visualization: The system offers visualization tools to help users understand accident trends.
Installation
To set up the Rail Accident Prediction system, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/SARAN-7050/rail-accident-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd rail-accident-prediction
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
Install project dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the Rail Accident Prediction system, follow these steps:

Ensure you have completed the installation steps.

Run the system:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to input data or choose options for historical analysis or real-time prediction.

Explore the results, including visualizations and accident likelihood scores.

Data
The dataset used for training the machine learning models can be found in the data/ directory. It includes historical rail accident records, with attributes such as date, location, weather conditions, and more. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Model Training
Machine learning models for accident prediction are implemented in the models/ directory. Various algorithms, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, are explored. Model training and evaluation scripts can be found in the train/ directory. Users can retrain models with updated data if needed.

Results
The system provides accident likelihood predictions and visualizations. Users can analyze historical trends and receive real-time predictions for specific scenarios. Results are saved in the results/ directory, including visualizations, prediction logs, and model evaluation reports.
